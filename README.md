# Train-Scheduler
## Overview
- This train sheduler is a fun and informative way to show and receive train information. It actively shows the train name, destination, frequency of the train, how many minutes away the train is, and the exact time of the next arrival. 

## How It Works
- To add the trains to the app, the user must simply fill out the form with all the information and hit the submit button. Some simple Javascript and JQuery were used to record and push the trains into the schedule. The train schedules are then stored in firebase updating the app in real time for anyone using it. Any new train schedules will stay in the scheduler even after refreshing the page.
