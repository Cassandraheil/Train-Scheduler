# Train-Scheduler
This train sheduler is a fun and informative way to show and recieve train information. It actively shows the train name, destination, frequency of the train, how many minutes away the train is, and the exact time of the next arrival. 


## How It Works-
This application uses a variety of different resources available for programmer's use. To add the trains to the app, some simple javascript and JQuery were used to record and push the trains into the schedule. The train schedules are then stored in firebase updating the app in real time for anyone using it. Any new train schedules will stay in the scheduler even after refreshing the page. The resource Moment.js was used to keep time properly working in the app. With moment.js, I was able to display the next arrival time based on the frequency of the train and the starting time of the day.
